Project 1
SeokHwan Song


Language: Pyhton 3
Library: numpy, copy, time, collections.namedtuple


How to run


1. Use ‘cd’ to get to the file where ‘Project1_SeokHwan_Song.py’ is located.
2. Run ‘python Project1_SeokHwan_Song.py’
3. You should only put integers.
4. It would be fine if you put wrong integers but it will stop when you put empty or strings.
